The evaluation occurs in the nodes of the abstract syntax tree, when the language is processed by some parser or compiler. - Wikipedia Silver: http://melt.cs.umn.edu/silver/ JastAdd: http://jastadd.org/web/ Metalanguages Broadly, any metalanguage is language or symbols used when language itself is being discussed or examined. In logic and linguistics, a metalanguage is a language used to make statements about statements in another language (the object language). Expressions in a metalanguage are often distinguished from those in an object language by the use of italics, quotation marks, or writing on a separate line. The structure of sentences and phrases in a metalanguage can be described by a metasyntax. - Wikipedia General purpose Xtend: https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/ Visual syntax Sirius: https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/ Parser Copper: http://melt.cs.umn.edu/copper/ ANTLR4: https://www.antlr.org/ Code Generation Javapoet: https://github.com/square/javapoet Epsilon EGL: https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/egl/ Acceleo: https://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/ Syntax Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF): https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/ Spoofax SDF3: http://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/langdev/meta/lang/sdf3/ .
